# Word 2 Emotions

This is a little personal project to experiment a little bit with WASM, Go and Sevelte.
The objective is to create a SPA that can use the WebSpeech API to recognize speech, then
convert the user voice and try to pedict what they are filling with NLP.

## Tech Stack

- SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS
- Go

## Deployment

I'm working in making an automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions!
